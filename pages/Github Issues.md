	  It would be even better if it can ignore #tag (which will become #[[tag]] right now after parsing).

	- Property values excluded on purpose? It would be great to have the option to at least enable it. I like my property values to be linked as well. It would eb especialy powerful paired with Logseq's auto-complete feature: Auto-complete then BOOM auto-link if there's a page associated to it. Thank you so much fro this plugin! Makes like in Logseq so much easier.

	  I've noticed that if I type quickly enough (well, normal speed, imo) that I have to wait for search results to come back before seeing whatever it was that I typed. I'm not super familiar with the codebase/Logseq plugins so I'm not too sure how to verify this, but figured it's worth raising.
	  
	  I'm happy to contribute a fix if need be, but might need some direction on Logseq's setup/debugging. (Plenty familiar with JS/TS, just not Logseq's plugin architecture.)

	  Need to scroll down as it adding in the end of the page 
	  or in case of different page defined (Location) - need to switch to that page.
	  
	  So it will be handy to have a flag saying something like "Cursor Jump"

	- Hi.
	  Great plugin, and thanks for much for all the plugins you do!
	  I am sure you have thought of this and have many other things on your plate.
	  
	  To show interest though, if this could perform OCR on PDFs in the Logseq reader, or on area highlights of PDFs in the Logseq reader I have referred to in my notes, that would be even more amazing. 
	  
	  I hope all is well,
	  
	  Thomas.

	  ```
	  description:actual file:file format
	  ```
	  for example a PDF file without a description:
	  ```
	  :files/some.pdf:PDF
	  ```
	  
	  This however does not work well together with this plugin, as in the template expansion the full content of the file entry is used.
	  Would it be possible to split up the string and provide separate template variables to be able to format the correct link?
	  Note, that in the `description` and `actual file` also colons can appear, but are escaped with `\`, for example:
	  ```
	  my\:description:http\://example.com:text/html

	- I tried to setup the plugin with a library that is not in `~/.logseq/storages/logseq-citation-manager` (the readme tells me that the folder is called `storage` but apparently it is `storages`?). I tried to use a relative path to that directory (i.e., `../../../papers/references.bib`), but that seems not to work. Do I understand this breaking change correctly that only files in that specific directory are read and nothing else? Thus, the only way to use other files outside that directory is by copying or linking? Or did I something wrong and thats why it wont read the file?

	- Currently in automatic linker, single words receive priority above multi-word page titles.
	  For example, having pages
	  
	  - Work Ethics
	  - Work
	  
	  And a random page with the text "Good work ethics are important.."
	  
	  Has the result that automatic linker only auto-links the single word 'work', resulting in 
	  "Good [[work]] ethics are important"
	  
	  This obviously is counter productive.
	  Better would be to prioritize the more specific multi-word title.

	- When currently adding a page for a reference that includes the link to the PDF, this link will include the full path to the file.
	  This leads to two issues:
	  
	  1. The path to the file is going to show up in the graph. This clutters the graph view quite a bit and to make it useable again every path needs to be manually excluded from the graph.
	  2. Using the same set of notes with another setup becomes difficult, the path to files might be different. If the path is different, this needs to be changed across the whole graph.
	  
	  I propose to instead use the same way for accessing files as is done when adding a reference via the build in Zotero integration. This would solve issue 1 and make issue 2 easier because the path would only need to be adjusted once in the settings.
	  The pattern for the Zotero integration seems to be: `{{zotero-imported-file key, "fileName"}}`. Getting to this could be accomplished with the template for File URLs. The variable `key` already seems to be available, so only the variable `fileName` would need to be added, which is part of `fileLink`.
	  
	  PS: Thank you for the great work of creating this plugin. It is very useful.
